This notebook contains information related to cost benchmarking of electricity supply facilities such as:
- Hydro power plant
- Solar photovoltaic systems
- Wind power systems
- Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS)
- Open Cycle Gas Turbine electricity generators

## Motivations for benchmarking
Economic regulators and other stakeholders want to have an independent method of evaluating the price of electricity that consumers pay. In the theory of competitive markets, the price of a good or service is based on:
- the efficient cost of operating a facility and
- a mark-up on cost that represents the normal return on an investment asset.

A benchmark model that is based on this theory will provide be a basis to compare the price being paid by consumers and the underlying cost. Prices that are systematically higher than the efficient cost will likely prompt an investigation to determine the underlying cause.

Investors deciding to purchase or build a facility will want to determine the likely competitiveness of the facility and directly estimate the return on investment. 

## Model design
The precise design of a cost benchmarking model is guided by user's needs. The level of detail required will vary and most will not want a model that is too complex and difficult to understand. The design will likely vary according to user needs:
- Economic regulators: Short-run and long-run marginal cost
- Investors: Project finance
- Levelised Cost of Energy: Policy evaluation of alternative technologies.

### Marginal cost model 
A marginal cost model is
