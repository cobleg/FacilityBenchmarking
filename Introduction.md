This notebook contains information related to cost benchmarking of electricity supply facilities such as:
- Hydro power plant
- Solar photovoltaic systems
- Wind power systems
- Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS)
- Open Cycle Gas Turbine electricity generators

## Motivations for benchmarking
Economic regulators and other stakeholders want to have an independent method of evaluating the price of electricity that consumers pay. In the theory of competitive markets, the price of a good or service is based on:
- the efficient cost of operating a facility and
- a mark-up on cost that represents the normal return on an investment asset.

A benchmark model that is based on this
