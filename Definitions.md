This section contains a few definitions of concepts related to facility benchmarking.

## Electricity system concepts

`Adequacy cost` is the cost of ensuring system adequacy.

`Back-up cost` is the cost of providing a redundant facility capable of substituting for the loss of another facility.

`Balancing cost` is the cost of maintaining the an alternating current electrical power system in balance at a target frequency. 

`Firm technology` describes facilities that convert a stored (or storable) primary energy source (e.g. diesel, natural gas) into electrical power on demand at a pre-determined rate (i.e. x MW/hour) over a specified time interval (e.g. x hours).

`Flexibility effect` is the impact on efficiency of conventional power plants for day-ahead operations.  [@ueckerdtSystemLCOEWhat2013]

`Full-load hour` shows how many hours a power generating facility would take to make a specified amount of energy. This is defined as the product of a facility's [capacity factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_factor) and the number of hours in a standard year (i.e. 8,760 hours). This measure can be used to examine how many hours a year a facility needs to operate to be profitable [@FullloadHoursEnergy]

`Full-load hour reduction` is the amount of hours in a standard year that a dispatchable facility is reduced due to the integration of variable renewable energy systems.

`Grid cost` is the cost of connecting to the grid.

`Integration cost` is the sum of balancing cost, grid cost and profile cost. [@ueckerdtSystemLCOEWhat2013]

`Non-firm technology` describes facilities that do not satisfy the full definition of `firm technology`. Variable renewable energy systems such as wind power and solar power are examples of non-firm technology.

`Operating reserve impact` refers to the near real-time adjustments required to respond to frequency disturbances to keep the power system within its target operating envelope. This can be considered as a source of uncertainty. A key source of this uncertainty is the operating of variable renewable energy systems that can suddenly change power output, typically in an uncontrolled manner.  [@ueckerdtSystemLCOEWhat2013]

`Over-production cost` is the cost incurred from over-production. This is associated with variable renewable energy systems producing more electrical power than can be accommodated by an electrical system. This imposes cost such as system congestion and forcing other facilities to reduce output.  [@ueckerdtSystemLCOEWhat2013]

`Profile cost` is the sum of over-production cost, full-load hour reduction and back-up costs induced by variable renewable energy systems. Profile cost is caused by fluctuations in VRE power generation profile [@ueckerdtSystemLCOEWhat2013]

`Standard integration cost` is the cost of adding a standard (or conventional) electrical power generating facility to an electrical system. These consist of adequancy cost, balancing cost, grid cost.

`System adequacy` measures the ability of a power system to cope with its load in stead states that it could operate under standard conditions [@SecuritySupplySystem]

`Variable renewable energy` (VRE) is an electrical power generation technology that converts a primary energy source, e.g. solar power, wind power systems, into electrical power. These systems produce electrical power in a largely uncontrolled, fluctuating manner. In doing so, VRE systems impose system costs consisting of: over-production cost, full-load hour reduction costs and back-up cost.
