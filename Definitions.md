This section contains a few definitions of concepts related to facility benchmarking.

## Electricity system concepts

`System adequacy` 

`Adequacy cost` is the cost of ensuring system adequacy.

`Back-up cost` is the cost of providing a redundant facility capable of substituting for the loss of another facility.

`Balancing cost` is the cost of maintaining the an alternating current electrical power system in balance at a target frequency. 

`Flexibility effect` is the impact on efficiency of conventional power plants for day-ahead operations.  [@ueckerdtSystemLCOEWhat2013]

`Operating reserve impact` refers to the near real-time adjustments required to respond to frequency disturbances to keep the power system within its target operating envelope. This can be considered as a source of uncertainty. A key source of this uncertainty is the operating of variable renewable energy systems that can suddenly change power output, typically in an uncontrolled manner.  [@ueckerdtSystemLCOEWhat2013]

`Over-production cost` is the cost incurred from over-production. This is associated with variable renewable energy systems producing more electrical power than can be accommodated by an electrical system. This imposes cost such as system congestion and forcing other facilities to reduce output.  [@ueckerdtSystemLCOEWhat2013]

`Profile cost` is the sum of over-production cost, full-load hour reduction and back-up costs induced by variable renewable energy systems. [@ueckerdtSystemLCOEWhat2013]

`Standard integration cost` is the cost of adding a standard (or conventional) electrical power generating facility to an electrical system. These consist of adequancy cost, balancing cost, grid cost.

`Variable renewable energy` (VRE) is an electrical power generation technology that converts a primary energy source, e.g. solar power, wind power systems, into electrical power. These systems produce electrical power in a largely uncontrolled, fluctuating manner. In doing so, VRE systems impose system costs consisting of: over-production cost, full-load hour reduction costs and back-up cost.
