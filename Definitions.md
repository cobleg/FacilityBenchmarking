This section contains a few definitions of concepts related to facility benchmarking.

## Electricity system concepts

`Back-up cost` is the cost of providing a redundant facility capable of substituting for the loss of another facility.

`Flexibility effect` is the impact on efficiency of conventional power plants for day-ahead operations.  [@ueckerdtSystemLCOEWhat2013]

`Operating reserve impact` refers to the near real-time adjustments required to respond to frequency disturbances to keep the power system within its target operating envelope. This can be considered as a source of uncertainty. A key source of this uncertainty is the operating of variable renewable energy systems that can suddenly change power output, typically in an uncontrolled manner.  [@ueckerdtSystemLCOEWhat2013]

`Profile cost` is the sum of over-production cost, full-load hour reduction and back-up costs induced by variable renewable energy systems.

`Standard integration cost` is the cost of adding a standard (or conventional) electric

`Variable renewable energy` (VRE) is an electrical power generation technology that converts a primary energy source, e.g. solar power, wind power systems, into electrical power. These systems produce electrical power in a largely uncontrolled, fluctuating manner. In doing so, VRE systems impose system costs consisting of: over-production cost, full-load hour reduction costs and back-up cost.
