Levelised Cost of Energy (LCoE) is a measure of the averge net present cost of energy that a facility of a specified type will produce over its expected operating life.

## Formulation
The LCoE is calculated as:

$$
LCoE = \frac{\text{sum of lifetime cost}}{\text{sum of lifetime energy produced}}
$$
$$
LCoE = \frac{\Sigma_{t=1}^{n}\frac{I_t+M_t+E_t}{(1+r)^t}}{\Sigma_{t=1}^{n}\frac{O_t}{(1+r)^t}}
$$

where
$I_t$ is investment expenditure in year $t$
$M_t$ is operations and maintenance cost in year $t$
$E_t$ is expenditure on primary energy in year $t$
$0 \lt r \le 1$ is the discount rate used to reflect the opportunity cost of waiting
$O_t$ is the output quantity in year $t$
